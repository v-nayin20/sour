    <p>
      Olivia Isabel Rodrigo (born February 20, 2003) is an American singer-songwriter and actress. She gained recognition for her lead roles on the Disney television programs Bizaardvark (2016–2019) and High School Musical: The Musical: The Series (2019–2022).
      After signing with Geffen and Interscope Records in 2020, Rodrigo released her debut single, "Drivers License", which broke various records and became one of the best-selling songs of 2021, propelling her to mainstream fame. She followed it up with singles "Deja Vu" and "Good 4 U", and released her debut studio album, Sour, in 2021, which was met with critical and commercial success, winning various accolades including three Grammy Awards. A Disney+ documentary, Olivia Rodrigo: Driving Home 2 U, followed in 2022, chronicling her creative process with Sour.

Mails Elementary School in Murrieta, participating in their after-school musical theater program.[18] Rodrigo was playing guitar by age 12.[17] Rodrigo first became interested in songwriting after listening to country music, especially singer-songwriter Taylor Swift.[16] She attended Dorothy McElhinney Middle School in Murrieta for a year, but when she landed her role on Bizaardvark moved to Los Angeles[18] and was homeschooled from 2016 until she graduated in 2021.[7][19]
